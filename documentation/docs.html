                  The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup
                  language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
                  browser. It is often assisted by technologies such as
                  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as
                  JavaScript.

                <li class="about-lang">
                  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
                  local storage and render the documents into multimedia web
                  pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                  and originally included cues for its appearance.
                </li>
                <li class="about-lang">
                  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such
                  as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web
                  pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of
                  content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former
                  maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS
                  standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
                  presentational HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as
                  HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the
                  canvas element, together with JavaScript.

                  CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
                  presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
                  separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
                  flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
                  characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting
                  by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
                  reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
                  and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load
                  speed between the pages that share the file and its
                  formatting.

                  The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to

                  is predictable.

                  JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language
                  that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web,
                  alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use
                  JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often
                  incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers
                  have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
                  users' devices.
                </li>
                <li class="about-lang">
                  JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
                  language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[10] It has
                  dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                  first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
                  event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
                  It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
                  with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data
                  structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                </li>
                <li class="about-lang">
                  The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output
                  (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In
                  practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides
                  JavaScript APIs for I/O. JavaScript engines were originally
                  used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                  servers and a variety of applications. The most popular
                  runtime system for this usage is Node.js. Although Java and
                  JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective
                  standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
                  greatly in design.

                  Structured Query Language (SQL) S-Q-L, sometimes "sequel" for
                  historical reasons, is a domain-specific language used in
                  programming and designed for managing data held in a
                  relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream
                  processing in a relational data stream management system
                  (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured
                  data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and
                  variables.

                <li class="about-lang">
                  Introduced in the 1970s, SQL offered two main advantages over
                  older read–write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it
                  introduced the concept of accessing many records with one
                  single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify
                  how to reach a record, i.e., with or without an index.

                <li class="about-lang">
                  Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational
                  calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may
                  be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly: a data query
                  language (DQL),a data definition language (DDL), a data
                  control language (DCL), and a data manipulation language
                  (DML). The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation
                  (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation
                  and modification), and data access control. Although SQL is
                  essentially a declarative language (4GL), it also includes
                  procedural elements.

                  C is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was
                  created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very
                  widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly
                  reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found
                  lasting use in operating systems, device drivers, protocol
                  stacks, though decreasingly for application software. C is
                  commonly used on computer architectures that range from the
                  largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and
                  embedded systems.

                  A successor to the programming language B, C was originally
                  developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to
                  construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to
                  re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
                  During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become
                  one of the most widely used programming languages, with C
                  compilers available for practically all modern computer
                  architectures and operating systems. The book The C
                  Programming Language, co-authored by the original language
                  designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for
                  the language. C has been standardized by ANSI since 1989 (ANSI
                  C) and by the International Organization for Standardization
                  (ISO).

                  C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured
                  programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, with a
                  static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide
                  low-level access to memory and language constructs that map
                  efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime
                  support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was
                  designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A
                  standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind
                  can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and
                  operating systems with few changes to its source code. Since
                  2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in
                  the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming
